// 1546 Staged transaction ledger / scenario 8 — Negative opening balance
// Amount text field accepts nonzero finite integer adjustments keeping balance in -8..8. Initial Balance=-2. Note requires trimmed text. Stage disabled when invalid, also guard submit. Stage hides form and shows Confirm/Cancel; Pending output is adjustment or none. Confirm commits once, clears drafts; Cancel discards pending but keeps drafts. Reset restores balance and clears drafts. Balance output never changes merely by staging.
